## Plus/minus parser

To complete this task, assign to `CalculatorGrammar.expression` a parser which produces <a href="psi_element://IntLiteral">IntLiteral</a>, <a href="psi_element://Plus">Plus</a> or <a href="psi_element://Minus">Minus</a>. Note that in this task both `Plus` and `Minus` operations are left-associative.

It might be easier to implement the functionality by looking at the following tests and making them pass one by one:
 - <a href="psi_element://Task8Tests#1 - subtract two numbers">subtract two numbers</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task8Tests#2 - add two numbers">add two numbers</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task8Tests#3 - subtract three numbers">subtract three numbers</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task8Tests#4 - add three numbers">add three numbers</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task8Tests#5 - add and subtract">add and subtract</a>

At this point, `CalculatorGrammar` object should more or less justify being called "grammar" by looking somewhat similar to grammar expressed in [Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).
