## Repeat parser

To complete this task, implement `onceOrMore()` function to return parser which applies the `parser` passed as an argument one or more times, or returns `null` if it can't be applied at all.

It might be easier to implement the functionality by looking at the following tests and making them pass one by one:
 - <a href="psi_element://Task4Tests#1 - no match">no match</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task4Tests#2 - match once">match once</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task4Tests#3 - match twice">match twice</a>
 - <a href="psi_element://Task4Tests#4 - match five times">match five times</a>
