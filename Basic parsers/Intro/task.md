Hi!

This is a bunch of koans which can guide you through the process of creating parser combinator in Kotlin from scratch. 

This is by no means a course on parsers but more of a very quick intro into the subject. 
To start with, ask yourself the following questions (this is not a quiz, so not being sure about the answer is perfectly fine):
 - What is a grammar? Context-free grammar?
 - What is a parser? Parser combinator?
 - What is "left recursion"?
 - What is the difference between "parse tree" and "abstract syntax tree"?
 - How would you write an interpreter to evaluate expressions like "(1 + 2) * 3 - 4"?

Note many of the koans depend on the previous ones, so the recommended way is to do them sequentially, at least the "Basic parsers" part.
